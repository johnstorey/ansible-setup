Nov 11 20:17:22 <loplin>	Hello. I am having an issue where I have tab indent enabled, but in certain scenarios C-M-\ indents with some tabs followed by a single space for a few lines, which looks to be aligning with an opening paren. How can I disable that behaviour?
Nov 11 20:17:25 <Anatzum>	I've recently started using emacs as a daemon to speed start up but there are a couple of variables I need set which I had in my .bash_profile. My PATH and a GOPATH variable. I've been doing some reading and how and where to place are all over the place and i'm not entirely sure which one is appropriate also If I do set them for systemd/user do I still keep them in my .bash_profile as well?

Nov 11 21:10:04 <trux>	Anatzum: yes, basically I'm in doubt If I switch my machine, how I will get all packages that I'm using right now, is there a way i can get all packages install automatically by emacs, if I put names of packages in emacs?

Nov 11 21:12:26 <Anatzum>	I actually never used init.el, I've always just stuck everything in my $HOME/.emacs file. This is what mine looks like. I didnt paste the whole thing it's too long but you get the general idea. https://codepaste.net/qkgzbc I made sure to list them in alphabetical order so its easy to look around

Nov 11 21:13:20 <Anatzum>	So basically if you do something like that all you have to do is hookup melpa, download use-package and then copy/paste your .emacs file and boom it's all setup
Nov 11 21:15:03 <Anatzum>	Not sure if there is a way to have melpa installed then download use-package first before any of the other items get called so that it is all automatic
Nov 11 21:18:19 <iRocki2>	wht community of emacs in india?
Nov 11 21:18:26 <trux>	Anatzum: please elaborate Not sure if there is a way to have melpa installed then download use-package first before any of the other items get called so that it is all automatic?
Nov 11 21:19:15 <trux>	iRocki2: yes Bangalore, Delhi emacs group
Nov 11 21:20:29 <iRocki2>	trux: bangalore? i m from bangalore
Nov 11 21:20:57 <iRocki2>	trux: pls ....share details
Nov 11 21:21:12 <trux>	iRocki2: check Bangalore emacs meetup group?
Nov 11 21:21:34 <iRocki2>	trux: ok. delhi also meetup group?
Nov 11 21:22:20 <Anatzum>	Once "use-package" is installed you can write packages in that format in the link I posted which will automatically download/install them from melpa and also set up your custom configurations for them as well. But in order for that to work 2 things must be done. 1) setup melpa, 2) install use-package
